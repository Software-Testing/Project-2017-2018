## Assignement

Each group of students shall choose one of the assignements. Each of these explore an aspect of software testing. It must be implemented in java as a maven project. 
The evaluation will focus on both the quality of the tool and its test suit.


### Assignement 1: Static Analysis

The goal of this assignement is to create a program able to detect code smells in java projects. A code smell is a region of code that exhibit commonly known poor pattern, resulting in error proneness.
 * Large classes or methods
 * High cyclomatic complexity
 * Duplicated code
 * potential NPE

 
### Assignement 2: Dynamic Analysis

The goal of this assignement is to create a program that computes the code coverage of a java project's tests.
 * Yes/no
 * Counter
 * Branch
 * Depth
 * Input Domain

### Assignement 3: Mutation Testing


### Improvements

 * UI
 * Additional features
 * ...
